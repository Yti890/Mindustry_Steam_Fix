# Mindustry_Steam_Fix

It only works on **Linux-Distro.**

Make sure you install open-jdk on your system.

Arch based Distro:
```bash
sudo pacman -S 	jdk-openjdk
```

Debian / Ubuntu based Distro:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install default-jdk
```

Rocky Linux / CentOS / Fedora based Distro:
```bash
sudo yum install java
```

If that not work, install **steam_appid.txt** and put to your **Mindustry** in **Steam**.
In path: "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry" or another directory.
